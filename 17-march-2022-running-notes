// todays topics
// 1. datatypes, 2.json objects 3. for loop

/*
Datatypes: string, number, boolean, arrays, objects
1. string:
var x = 'hello' // string declaration
let x = 'hello'
const x = 'hello'



there is a small difference between var and let
when used const and declared a variable, then you cannot change its value

 x = 'hello'
console.log(x)

// string declaration
when there is a statement starting with var or let or const and followed by a word, then it is called a declaration

// for example: var aditya = 'man' // this is a declaration

// declaration vs defination
// var aditya; // this is just a declaration
// aditya = 'man' // this is just a defination and tells the value of aditya i.e value of aditya is 'man'

// var aditya = 'man' // this is declaring that aditya is a valid entity and his value is defined as a 'man'

var
Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

let
Declares a block scope local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

const
Declares a read-only named constant.
